Hey, Wecome to my THA's Repo.
My 3 commits are with the same name. Beacuse there was a issue in my repo. The remote repo was 2 commits ahead of the local repo. So I was not able to push to the remote repo.
So to solve this issue I used the git pull --reabse origin master which synced both of th repo.
